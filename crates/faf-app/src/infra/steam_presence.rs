//! Steam's "playing Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance", for exactly as long as
//! a game runs (issue 364).
//!
//! Steam counts a process as playing app N once that process has called
//! `SteamAPI_Init` as app N through Valve's Steamworks API library, and stops
//! when it calls `SteamAPI_Shutdown` or exits. The Java client makes that call
//! from the client itself, once, at startup (`SteamService`), which is why its
//! status and the hours Steam records cover the client being open rather than a
//! game being played. That is the complaint the issue was opened with.
//!
//! Here the call is made by a helper: this client's own executable started again
//! with [`HELPER_FLAG`], which loads the library, signs in as app
//! [`FORGED_ALLIANCE_APP_ID`], and watches the game's process. When the game
//! exits, the helper shuts the API down and exits too, and the status goes with
//! it. A separate process rather than this one, for three reasons:
//!
//! * `SteamAPI_Init` loads Steam's own client library into whichever process
//!   calls it. That should not be the process holding the player's session and
//!   the webview.
//! * Valve does not support initialising again after a shutdown in the same
//!   process, and one client runs many games.
//! * A helper that dies for any reason takes the status with it. A flag in this
//!   process could outlive the game it was about.
//!
//! Windows and Linux, the two platforms this client is released for. On Linux
//! the game runs through Wine or Proton but the library is the native one, and
//! it talks to the native Steam client, which does not mind that app 9420 is a
//! Windows game: ownership is what it checks. The process watched there is the
//! one the launch wrapper started, the same one the launcher already waits on
//! to notice the game ending.
//!
//! Off unless the player turns it on (`GamePreferences::steam_presence`), and
//! quiet when it cannot work: no library in this build, Steam not running, or
//! Forged Alliance not in the signed-in account's library. Each of those is a
//! log line, never a message to the player, because none of them is something
//! going wrong with the game.
//!
//! The library is Valve's and is not covered by this client's MIT licence: it is
//! redistributed under the Steamworks SDK Access Agreement, see
//! `vendor/steamworks/README.md`. Nothing here talks to Steam except through it,
//! which is what the agreement's section 2.4 asks.
