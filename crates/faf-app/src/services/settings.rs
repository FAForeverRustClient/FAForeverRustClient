//! Settings service.
//!
//! Loads persisted settings at startup and persists changes. Note the persistence
//! pattern: the service emits the event first (so the single reduce chokepoint
//! updates the authoritative state), then reads the *post-reduce* settings back
//! from the sink and hands the whole slice to the port. This keeps services free
//! of any direct state mutation while still persisting the resulting state.
//!
//! It also owns the install check. Any path change ends in [`sync_installs`],
//! which pushes the new paths into the process port (so a freshly picked
//! install works immediately instead of at the next restart) and then stats
//! them, emitting an [`InstallEvent`] for the missing-install banner. Doing it
//! here rather than behind a separate command means there is no way to change a
//! path without the check running.
