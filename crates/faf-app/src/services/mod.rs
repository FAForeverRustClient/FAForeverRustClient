//! Business logic. One module per feature.
//!
//! A service consumes a command, performs side effects through [`crate::ports`],
//! and emits events via the [`EventSink`](crate::EventSink). A service **never**
//! touches `AppState` directly (ARCHITECTURE.md §3.4).

/// The wall clock as Unix seconds.
///
/// Shared because three services need it for the same reason: deciding
/// whether something has already happened: and three copies is three chances
/// to get the saturation wrong. Saturates at zero rather than wrapping: a clock
/// set before 1970 would otherwise become a colossal future timestamp, which
/// reads as "every tournament has finished" and "every match is old enough to
/// spectate".
